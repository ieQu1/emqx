Improve Kafka connector error logs.

Previously, specific error details, such as unreachable advertised listeners, were not logged.
Now, error details are captured in the logs to provide more diagnostic information.
To manage log verbosity, only the first occurrence of an error is logged, accompanied by the total count of similar errors.
